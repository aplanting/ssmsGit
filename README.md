SQL Server Management Studio Source Control with Git

## Synopsis
This project is an collection of software and t-sql code in order to get youre SQL Server under version control without the need to install expensive tools like RedGate's solution for source control. All the code and assemblies are free to use.
It will take some time and skill to get it running but I will try to be as detailed as possible. The setup has some requirements to get it to work but if you are as resourcefull as me you can adjust it so it works for youre environment.
